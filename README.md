# Age Binder

(Currently in alpha stage).

This web-application creates fictional worlds, with simulated geographies and histories - including multiple civilizations, religions, economy, wars... It can be used as a living digital diorama, as a support tool for creative writing or table-top role-playing and as a hobby project for programming research.

Create your own worlds here: https://tukkek.github.io/age-binder/!

## Features

- Generate an infinite number of detailed worlds, for free, in your browser!
- Watch your worlds evolve age-by-age, year-by-year while history unfolds!
- Hove over each area of the game world for an overview of local details
- Reproduce previous worlds by entering the same name again

## Performance

For the convenience of being hosted in a browser, Age Binder doesn't have the same ease of access to performance techniques readily available to other programs. As such, it's not as fast as it could be in an ideal scenario. It's performance is adequate for the vast majority of scenarios but if you are running an ultra-high resolution setup and are experiencing very slow generation, reducing the size of your browser window before opening the application should help.

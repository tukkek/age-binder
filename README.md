# Age Binder

This web-application creates fictional worlds, with simulated geographies and histories - including multiple civilizations, religions, economy, conflicts... It can be used as a living digital diorama; as a support tool for creative writing or table-top role-playing or simply as a hobby programming project.

While not as in-depth as more ambitious generators, Age Binder is designed to paint a picture of a world in broad strokes, allowing creative minds to fill-in the blanks with their own imagination and ideas.

## Features

- Long-term geography generation featuring: 
  - Biomes; weather; altitude; humidity; terrain types; bodies of water and over 20 natural resources.
- Short-term history simulation featuring:
  - 3 types of settlements and notable families and figures, with ranks and characteristics.
- Name and noun generation for both real and fantasy languages.
- Clicking anywhere on the map will let you explore a location in detail, revealing:
  - Geography; political and population overviews.
  - Lineages; figures-of-interest and settlements.
- Define your own peoples and cultures or choose between several built-in sets.
- Reproduce worlds by entering the same scenario name again.
- A full log of world events.

## Controls

Other than the detailed views that let you better examine your worlds, Age Binder also has a few basic controls for pausing and resuming the simulation - and also a step-by-step function that will let the simulation play until the next major world event happens and then automatically pause it again.

Play and pause can be toggled with the `space-bar` key and stepping can be engaged with `right-arrow`. Hitting `escape` will close open panels.

Age Binder's design allows for both simple worlds with only a few settlements and also more detailed; expansive worlds with lots of information to draw from. This is achieved by choosing when to pause the simulation: letting it run for longer will continue evolving and adding detail, to the user's preference.

While there isn't a fully-featured save-and-load method, worlds created with the same name (seed) will be identical every time you generate them using the same version of Age Binder - so it is also possible and convenient to reproduce a world, should you want to do so.

## Performance

For the convenience of being hosted in a browser, Age Binder doesn't have the same ease of access to performance techniques readily available to other programs. As such, it's not as fast as it could be in an ideal scenario.

The performance is serviceable for the vast majority of cases but if you are running an ultra-high resolution setup or are experiencing very slow generation, reducing the size of your browser window before creating a new world should help.
